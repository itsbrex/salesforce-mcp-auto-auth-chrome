# Salesforce MCP Server — Auto-Auth From Chrome

A local MCP server that exposes **14 Salesforce tools** (SOQL, SOSL, CRUD, Apex execute, tooling API, REST) inside Claude Desktop — and **auto-refreshes the session from your Chrome browser** so you never have to paste a token into your config again. Wraps [`mcp-salesforce-connector`](https://pypi.org/project/mcp-salesforce-connector/) on PyPI; runs as a stdio MCP launched per-org by Claude Desktop.

No connected app, no OAuth dance, no copy-pasting session ids — just stay logged into the org in Chrome.

---

## How it fits together

```
Claude Desktop ── stdio ──▶ this package (Python) ── HTTPS ──▶ Salesforce REST API
       │                            │
       │                            └─ reads `sid` cookie ──▶ Chrome cookies on disk
       │                                  on every API call         (macOS Keychain)
       │
       └── one entry in claude_desktop_config.json per Salesforce org
```

The package is a thin Python shim around `mcp-salesforce-connector`. On every API call, it reads the `sid` cookie that Chrome stores when you're logged into Salesforce, and uses it as the `Authorization` header. That cookie value is identical to a Salesforce session id and is accepted as a Bearer token by the REST API. As long as you keep a Chrome tab open on the org, the session stays alive and Claude inherits the freshness.

## Files in this repo

- **`src/salesforce_mcp_auto_auth_chrome/__main__.py`** — entry point. Reads `SALESFORCE_INSTANCE_URL` from env, seeds a placeholder access token, installs the per-call patch, and hands off to `mcp-salesforce-connector`.
- **`src/salesforce_mcp_auto_auth_chrome/patch.py`** — monkey-patches `simple_salesforce.Salesforce._call_salesforce` so every API call gets a fresh `sid` from Chrome.
- **`src/salesforce_mcp_auto_auth_chrome/auth.py`** — reads the `sid` cookie from Chrome via `pycookiecheat`. Returns `None` on any failure so callers can defer the error to tool-call time.
- **`pyproject.toml`** — package metadata + entry point. `uvx` reads this when launching.
- **`examples/claude_desktop_config.example.json`** — copy-paste-ready Claude Desktop config snippet.
- **`docs/how-it-works.md`** — full architecture write-up with the design decisions, what we tried and discarded, and the lessons that generalize to other MCP wrappers.

## Setup — Part 1: Add to Claude Desktop (~1 min, one-time)

### 1. Open your Claude Desktop config

On macOS the file lives at:

```
~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

### 2. Add one entry per Salesforce org

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "salesforce-mydevorg": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "git+https://github.com/kugamon/salesforce-mcp-auto-auth-chrome",
        "salesforce-mcp-auto-auth-chrome"
      ],
      "env": {
        "SALESFORCE_INSTANCE_URL": "https://yourdomain.my.salesforce.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `yourdomain.my.salesforce.com` with your actual My Domain (the URL host when you're logged into Salesforce — everything before `/lightning`). **Don't set `SALESFORCE_ACCESS_TOKEN`** — the wrapper pulls it from Chrome.

To add multiple orgs, repeat the block under a different key — `salesforce-prod`, `salesforce-sandbox`, `salesforce-dev1`, etc. Each gets its own `SALESFORCE_INSTANCE_URL`. See [`examples/claude_desktop_config.example.json`](examples/claude_desktop_config.example.json) for a complete template.

### 3. Restart Claude Desktop

Cmd+Q (a full quit — not just closing the window) and reopen. Claude Desktop reads the config at startup.

### 4. Sanity check

In a new Claude conversation, ask: *"using salesforce-mydevorg, what's the org name?"* — Claude will call the `run_soql_query` tool with `SELECT Name FROM Organization`. If it returns your org's name, the wiring is correct.

The first time the wrapper runs, macOS will prompt for Keychain access (the dialog says *"Claude wants to use your confidential information stored in 'Chrome Safe Storage'"*). Click **Always Allow** to suppress future prompts.

---

## Setup — Part 2: Stay logged in to Salesforce in Chrome

This is the "config" for this MCP: just keep a Chrome tab open on your Salesforce org. The wrapper reads cookies from Chrome on every API call — if you log out (or your session times out without any browser activity), the next tool call returns:

> *Not logged into Salesforce in Chrome for https://yourdomain.my.salesforce.com. Open that org in Chrome, sign in, then retry.*

Sign back in and the next tool call works again — no need to restart Claude Desktop.

## The 14 tools

All 14 come from the underlying [`mcp-salesforce-connector`](https://pypi.org/project/mcp-salesforce-connector/) — this package just adds auto-auth on top.

### Query (2)

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `run_soql_query` | Run any SOQL `SELECT` against the org |
| `run_sosl_search` | Cross-object full-text search via SOSL |

### Records — single (5)

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `get_record` | Read one record by Id from any SObject |
| `create_record` | Insert one record |
| `update_record` | Update one record by Id |
| `delete_record` | Delete one record by Id |
| `get_object_fields` | Describe an SObject's fields, picklists, relationships |

### Records — bulk (3)

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `bulk_create_records` | Bulk insert via the Composite REST API |
| `bulk_update_records` | Bulk update via the Composite REST API |
| `bulk_delete_records` | Bulk delete via the Composite REST API |

### Code & metadata (3)

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `apex_execute` | Run anonymous Apex |
| `tooling_execute` | Tooling API access (deploy, query metadata, etc.) |
| `list_sobjects` | List every standard + custom SObject |

### Raw REST (1)

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `restful` | Make a raw REST call against any Salesforce endpoint |

Each tool's full schema is advertised through the MCP `tools/list` method — Claude reads it automatically.

## How auth actually flows

```
You: "salesforce-mydevorg, run SELECT Name FROM Account LIMIT 5"
  │
  ▼
Claude Desktop → stdio → salesforce-mcp-auto-auth-chrome process (Python)
  │
  ▼
mcp-salesforce-connector calls simple_salesforce.Salesforce.query()
  │
  ▼
simple_salesforce calls Salesforce._call_salesforce()  ← OUR MONKEY-PATCH RUNS HERE
  │
  ├─ Read Chrome's `sid` cookie for kuga-dev-ed.my.salesforce.com
  │  (decrypts Chrome's cookie store using macOS Keychain)
  │
  ├─ If sid present → overwrite session_id + Authorization header
  ├─ If sid absent → raise RuntimeError → surfaces as tool error in chat
  │
  ▼
HTTPS GET https://kuga-dev-ed.my.salesforce.com/services/data/v59.0/query?q=...
  Authorization: Bearer <fresh sid from Chrome>
  │
  ▼
Salesforce returns rows → MCP tool result → Claude → you
```

The patch is class-level, runs once at startup, and is invisible to the connector. Upstream improvements to `mcp-salesforce-connector` flow through without changes here.

---

## Why a local wrapper (vs. alternatives we tried)

- **A remote MCP (Cloudflare Worker, etc.) can't read your local Chrome cookies.** The whole value here is "use my browser's session as the API session" — that requires local file-system access to Chrome's encrypted cookie store. A remote server would still need you to paste a token.
- **Forking `mcp-salesforce-connector` to add a `--auth-from-chrome` flag** means maintaining a fork forever and diverging from upstream. Monkey-patching at the `simple_salesforce._call_salesforce` boundary stays out of the way.
- **OAuth (connected app per org)** is the "right" answer for production automation but is heavy for sandbox/dev work where you change orgs frequently and the session token IS what you want. For prod, stick with the standard connector's OAuth config.
- **Caching the `sid` for N minutes** sounds smart but causes more stale-token errors than the per-call read adds latency. Reading from Chrome's encrypted cookie store costs sub-100ms. We do it per call.
- **Failing loudly at startup** when no session was found gave annoying "Server disconnected" warnings every time you restarted Claude Desktop with orgs you weren't actively using. We now defer auth errors to the moment a tool is invoked.

The full architecture write-up — including each of these and how we picked the current shape — is in [`docs/how-it-works.md`](docs/how-it-works.md).

## Local development

If you want to test changes before pushing:

```bash
# Install Python 3.12+ and uv if you don't have them
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone and run from source
git clone https://github.com/kugamon/salesforce-mcp-auto-auth-chrome.git
cd salesforce-mcp-auto-auth-chrome
uv sync

# Smoke-test against an org you're logged into in Chrome
SALESFORCE_INSTANCE_URL=https://yourdomain.my.salesforce.com \
  uv run python -m salesforce_mcp_auto_auth_chrome
```

The process will start, print `[salesforce-mcp-auto-auth-chrome v0.1.0] Ready for ...`, and wait for MCP JSON-RPC on stdin.

To point your local Claude Desktop config at the working copy instead of the published repo, change the args to:

```jsonc
"args": ["run", "--directory", "/absolute/path/to/your/checkout", "python", "-m", "salesforce_mcp_auto_auth_chrome"]
```

## Behavior reference

### At Claude Desktop startup

| Logged into org in Chrome? | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| Yes | MCP server starts, all tools register, first call uses fresh `sid` |
| No | MCP server **still starts** — no "Server disconnected" warning. Errors surface only when you actually call a tool. |

### When you invoke a tool

| Logged into org in Chrome? | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| Yes | A fresh `sid` is read from Chrome and used for that call. Result returns normally. |
| No | Tool call returns: *"Not logged into Salesforce in Chrome for https://… . Open that org in Chrome, sign in, then retry."* |

### Token refresh cadence

Every API call. The `sid` from Chrome is read fresh each time — Salesforce sessions effectively never expire mid-conversation as long as your Chrome tab is still alive.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Claude shows "Server disconnected" at startup**: Almost always means the wrapper failed to import something — usually `pycookiecheat` or `mcp-salesforce-connector`. Look at `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-<name>.log` for the actual Python traceback. Most fixes are a `uvx --reinstall` or running `uv sync` if you're working from a local clone.

**`Not logged into Salesforce in Chrome for ...`** in chat: The wrapper couldn't find a `sid` cookie for the configured instance URL. Open that org in Chrome, sign in, then retry your Claude request. No Claude restart needed — the next tool call reads cookies fresh.

**Keychain prompt keeps appearing**: The first time the wrapper reads cookies, macOS asks permission to access "Chrome Safe Storage" via Keychain. Click **Always Allow** — not "Allow" — and the prompt won't return.

**Wrong instance URL?**: Look at the URL bar when logged into Salesforce — it'll be `https://yourdomain.my.salesforce.com/lightning/...`. Use the host (before `/lightning`) as `SALESFORCE_INSTANCE_URL`. Dev sandboxes often look like `https://yourname-dev-ed.develop.my.salesforce.com`.

**`HTTP 401` from Salesforce on every call**: The `sid` cookie you have is valid for the UI session but the org may have "Lock sessions to the IP address from which they originated" enabled with a strict policy. If so, switch that org to OAuth-based auth via the standard `mcp-salesforce-connector` config.

**Want to use Firefox/Safari/Brave/Arc instead of Chrome**: Not yet — today the wrapper only checks Chrome's cookie store. Adding other browsers is a small change to `auth.py` (pycookiecheat supports several). PRs welcome.

**Cookie reads work in Chrome standalone but the MCP can't read them**: The MCP process needs permission to access Keychain. If you ever click "Don't Allow" on the Keychain prompt by accident, open Keychain Access → search for "Chrome Safe Storage" → right-click → "Get Info" → "Access Control" → add the `uv` executable, or just delete the entry and let Chrome recreate it.

**Want to see what the wrapper is doing?**: Logs go to stderr, which Claude Desktop captures at `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-<name>.log`. The wrapper prints `[salesforce-mcp-auto-auth-chrome v0.1.0] Ready for ...` at startup and `cookie read failed: ...` on individual failures.

## Comparison with the standard `mcp-salesforce-connector`

| | This wrapper | Standard `mcp-salesforce-connector` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time setup | Add JSON entry + log into Chrome | Add JSON entry + paste session token (or set up OAuth connected app) |
| Token renewal | Automatic, every API call | Manual (paste new token every ~2 hours) or OAuth refresh |
| Works without Chrome | No (by design) | Yes — uses whatever you put in env vars |
| Works with multiple orgs | Yes — one entry per org | Yes — one entry per org |
| Production / automation use | Not recommended — depends on browser session | Recommended (OAuth flow) |
| Code dependency | Wraps `mcp-salesforce-connector` (no fork) | Direct |

Use this wrapper for daily dev work. Use the standard connector + OAuth for production automation.
